What I'm doing now

**Reading Book Bag**

- The Body: A Guide for Occupants by Bill Bryson
- Karma: A yogi's guide to crafting your destiny by Sadhguru

**Writing**

I am writing a book full-time on functional programming in Javascript along with occasional blog posts. By far the best thing I've ever done.

It's hard work but I've been most excited about it for last couple of years.

**Learning**

I'm going through [MIT Deep Learning course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) to revise fundamentals on Machine Learning(ML). I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to build ML powered applications

**Music**

- _Violin:_ Being a self-taught musician, I spend some time to practice Violin daily in Carnatic music. This is primarily a vocal oriented music accompanied with Violin commonly associated to south India. On varnams now(a type of composition with short metric pieces usually taught to beginners and intermediates)
- _Keyboard:_ Following [Alfred's Basic Adult All-in-One Course, Book 1](https://www.amazon.com/Alfreds-Basic-Adult-All-Course-ebook/dp/B017OBN7CK/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1619288728&refinements=p_lbr_books_series_browse-bin%3AAlfred%27s+Basic+Adult+Piano+Course&s=books&sr=1-1).90% completed. I like keyboard for it's ability to compose melody with harmony swiftly.
- _DAW:(Digital Audio Workstation):_ Ableton Live and Garage Band for electronic music.

**Walk**

I set some time aside to walk. With no goals or end points, I just walk alone. Thoughts pop out of my head and ideas come through. I value my time for walk as an introspection. Writing to me is 90% walking and 10% typing. So I walk to write. Health benefits are add-ons.

My marriage is on the cards. So I am on shopping spree!
