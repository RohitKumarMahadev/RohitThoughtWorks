A good book is something which can’t be condensed. It is an entity of its own. A tight structure with every element kept intact. which can’t be compressed further. We can only narrate a story out of it. It is a singleton.

John Gray with the book Soul of Marionette argues that Humanity is trapped in material(soul-less)world without any insights on their own motives and intentions. Like a marionettes with no access
to inherent purpose of their journey, we are carry forward by evolution on genetic strings. From Gnostic faith to active religion, humans attribute this mystical hand to God to seek meaning and purpose but no Gnosis can provide an escape from this confinement. Evolution is carrying us to and end-state designed by a proto-entity which itself is estranged from its own intent.

Impressions and beliefs without any priviliged access to underlying cause and effect produce false narratives. Emperical world is not quite real and only seemingly real within which we can’t appeal to God for re-dressing these imperfections. With Evil and suffering along with the absurdities remains a major part of World, we seek for bening agencies to endow us with knowledge and freedom to resolve inner conflicts for optimistic future. Throught out generations, search for meaning continues.

He mentions that the next generation species with super human abilities still try to define meaning and purpose but the spirit of matter with internal strife remains same. To make humanity free from inner conflict, Gray suggests to accept the situation as is. To let meanings come and go rather than try to impose sense on self. After all we are curious seekers and this very process to quest for favorable future makes us advance better along the journey of evolution. Enlightenment is not a destination but an odyssey to realize limitations of sentient life forms.

With several excerpts from different authors, Gray supports his stance through out the book. While contemporary researchers argue that humanity is improving, John Gray stays on the other end of spectrum. He protrudes the limitations of humanity, makes us to look at the face value many self-deceptions behind our aclaim for freedom. Like fairground puppets, we dream of escaping the burden of choice altogether. We seek for freedom. Freedom is an illusion.
