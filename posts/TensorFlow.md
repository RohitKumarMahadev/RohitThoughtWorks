TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning(ML) from Google.It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

To differentiate your proficiency in using TensorFlow to solve deep learning problems and to get recognized for your skills, TensorFlow team offers a certification program to demonstrate practical machine learning skills through the building and training of models.

I have been going through ML from past 6 months and set a mini-milestone along my learning journey to take certification exam. Utility of skills beyond certifications is of utmost importance to me. As with everything in life, you gotta be tested once in a while. After all it is a matter of joy to crack open something and quench your thirst of curiosity.

So I made a curriculum to pass the exam based on

- **Exam Syllabus**: TensorFlow Developer Certification Handbook available for [free](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf).
- **Book:** Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet
- **Course:**[DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)
