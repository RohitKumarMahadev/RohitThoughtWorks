TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source library for machine learning(ML) from Google.It has a flexible ecosystem of tools that lets developers and researchers build and deploy easily the state-of-the-art ML powered applications.

TensorFlow team offers a certification program to demonstrate and recognize practical machine learning skills through building and training of models to solve deep learning problems

I have been going through ML from past 6 months and set a mini-milestone along my learning journey to take certification exam. Utility of skills beyond certifications is of utmost importance to me. As with everything in life, you gotta be tested once in a while. After all it is a matter of fun to crack open something and quench your thirst of curiosity.

So I made a curriculum to pass the exam based on

- **Exam Syllabus**: TensorFlow Developer Certification Handbook available for [free](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf).
- **Book:** Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet
- **Course:**[DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)
- **Practice:** Exercises and labs mentioned in above book and course.
- **Environment:** Installed free [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) on my 2014 Macbook Pro(No GPU) to practice and also to take exam. You may also practice the code in the colab provided in course.

Reading the book slowly to gain intuition, and watching course lessons to understand concepts along with practice code in colab and/or pycharm is good enough to clear the exam. No GPU is necessary unless you want to finish the exam early within stipulated time(5 hours).

Further details about exam environment setup and FAQs are avilable [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf?authuser=4). You'll get a feedback right away each time you submit the model during the exam.

Using the above curriculam, If I am able to do it,you can do it as well. Best wishes!
