Envy. I have to write it. Envy originated within has its seeds sprouted from insecurity. A tinge of envy can have its deep roots spread across various aspects of life by labelling/identification of accumulation with self.
One's own gathering is different from **self** and this accumulation cannot be set by the side of others which breeds to envy. The least common denominator is the fact that energies remains same as one. Perception of accumulation might vary across and thoughts that breeds from this source can derilect the managed self-effacing perceptions.

Managed self is an idea which contradicts the very fact that self cannot be managed. self exists and it can only be known, percieved and dissolved. Through one's own identifications with their heaps and promoting their idealogies to influence other accumulation can be categorized under baseless perceptions. Publicizing the accumulation stems from the deep roots of insecurity on their gathered heaps which is very much obvious and exposed to oneself than any other.

Clearer minds can have a finer separation of accumulation and self. Hawk eye can bring a sense of clarity to view the gap between these two ends. Gatherings are left behind and given back with energy remains as is. Swan which gathers raw materials of life to create goldilocks to initiate certain actions and plotted across time dimension varies with bag of tendencies left behind. Bigger the bag, the more vibrations. Swift navigations through hilly terrains of deep influences is a difficult task. It might take certain period of time to minimize the amplifications generated out of it. Pockets of life energies move around with their tendencies.

It might need help of living to reduce the crests of energies lingering around. I disagree with the fact that these tendencies are fully outgrown without any controlling factor by senses. After all energy is neither created nor destroyed one can only wait for it self decimate to house another accumulation. This recycle action lies in the center of self operated mechanics of life process.

What about those realised beings who just cuts this process of recycling to reach beyond?
