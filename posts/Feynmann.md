A great example of a simple mental model for learning is The Feynman Technique from the Nobel-prize-winning scientist Richard Feynman. He defined this simple model to learn and understand anything:

- Choose a concept.
- Explain it to a toddler.
- Identify gaps and go back to the source material.
- Repeat until all gaps are eliminated.

This approach is especially useful in today’s world of information overload, perpetual busyness, and dubious “facts.” This technique helps to understand the difference between knowing **something** and knowing the **name of something**.When you know something, the labels are unimportant, because it’s not necessary to keep it in the box it came in.

It’s easy to think you understand a concept after reading a few blog posts and skimming through a book about the topic. But when you apply Feynman’s model you’ll often realize there are gaps in your knowledge.

Now you know what to do!
